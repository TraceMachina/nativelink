Trace Machina secures funding and launches NativeLink out of stealth to
deliver simulation infrastructure for safety-critical technologies

Today marks an exciting milestone for Trace Machina as we officially come
out of stealth mode and secured $4.7 million in seed funding to drive our
mission forward.


First, I am immensely grateful for the work that has been put in by the
entire Trace Machina team to get us here today. I’d like to thank our lead
investor, Van Jones from Wellington Management for believing in our vision
from the start. In addition to our partners at Samsung Next, Green Bay
Ventures, and Verissimo Ventures for everything they have done.
Instrumental angel investors and mentors including Clem Delangue, CEO of
Hugging Face, Mitch Wainer, Co-founder of DigitalOcean, Gert Lackriet,
Director of Applied Machine Learning at Amazon; and other industry leaders
from OpenAI and MongoDB.


Why we started Trace Machina
The inception of Trace Machina originated from a shared vision among a
group of passionate engineers and product leaders who have experience
developing cutting-edge technologies and solving complex problems in AI,
robotics, and autonomous systems at companies including Apple and Google.


Nathan Bruer, my Co-Founder, and I have always been driven by the challenge
of pushing the boundaries of technology. Nathan’s work at Google X on
autonomous driving software and my contributions to MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and other major open source projects laid the foundation for what
would become Trace Machina. We realized there was a significant gap in the
market for a robust simulation infrastructure that could support the
development of advanced systems. This realization led to the birth of Trace
Machina.


We're committed to developing tools that enable teams working on advanced
technologies like physical AI, specialized chip design, robotics, and
autonomous mobility. Our mission is to enable the next generation of
builders to create technology that has previously been unattainable or
uneconomical.


Launching NativeLink
NativeLink, our first product, embodies this mission. It's an open-source,
Rust-based simulation infrastructure platform designed to provide an
advanced simulation environment for technologies where safety is paramount.


NativeLink is the only platform for Bazel, Buck2, and Reclient written in
native code, tailored to handle large objects and intricate systems, across
native and interpreted programming languages.


From self-driving cars to aviation and robotics, NativeLink brings AI to
the edge, turning local devices into supercomputers and drastically
reducing cloud costs and accelerating builds.


NativeLink powers over one billion requests per month for some of the
largest companies in the world, providing speed and reliability in your
production workloads that unlocks possibilities previously unattainable
with any existing solution.


What's next
As we launch out of stealth, we're excited to share our vision and invite
the community to join us in building the future.


NativeLink is free and open source forever. With over a thousand stars on
GitHub and contributions from engineers at Tesla, General Motors, Samsung,
and others, we will continue to make NativeLink the best in class for
safety-critical technologies. Our focus will be on improving its
capabilities and expanding its adoption across various industries.


Building a strong, collaborative community is at the heart of our mission.
We encourage developers, engineers, and researchers to join our Slack,
contribute to our projects, and share their feedback. Together, we can
drive innovation and create a safer, more advanced future.


We’re already working on additional tools and infrastructure solutions to
address the evolving needs of developers in AI and autonomous systems. Stay
tuned for more announcements as we continue to innovate and push the
boundaries of what’s possible.


Trace Machina is more than just a company; it’s a movement. We invite you
to be a part of this exciting journey as we strive to revolutionize the
development of safety-critical technologies.


Thank you for your support.

CEO and Co-Founder, Trace Machina
