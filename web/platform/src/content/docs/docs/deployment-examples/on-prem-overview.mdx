illustrative and shouldn't be directly copied for production setups.
:::

This section provides several examples of deploying NativeLink to an
on-premises Kubernetes setup. These examples aren't intended for
production use, but rather to serve as basic, illustrative guides for
using NativeLink in a custom Kubernetes environment.

Each example leverages some of the latest, cutting-edge Kubernetes
configurations, but with a simplified architecture that prioritizes
understandability. This approach allows you to grasp the fundamental
concepts and operations involved in deploying NativeLink on-premises,
without getting overwhelmed by complex production-grade setups.

You can modify and expand these setups to better suit your specific
needs.

If you have any specific questions about adding NativeLink to existing or
new setups, feel free to ask for help in our
[Slack](https://nativelink.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-281qk1ho0-krT7HfTUIYfQMdwflRuq7A#/shared-invite/email).
