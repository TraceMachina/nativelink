description: 'An example setup for NativeLink in Kubernetes'
---

In this example you'll spin up a local Kubernetes cluster with NativeLink and
run some Bazel builds against it.

**Requirements**

- An `x86_64-linux` system. Either "real" Linux or WSL2.
- A functional local Docker setup.
- A recent version of Nix with flake support, for instance installed via the
  [next-gen Nix installer](https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer).

:::caution
This example doesn't work on Mac yet.

## ☁️ Prepare the cluster

First, enter the NativeLink development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink && \
    cd nativelink && \
    nix develop
```

This environment contains Bazel and some cloud tooling, so you don't need to set
up any kubernetes-related software yourself.

Now, start the development cluster:

```bash
native up
```

:::tip
The `native up` command uses Pulumi under the hood. You can view and delete
the stack with `pulumi stack` and `pulumi destroy`. If you're queried for a
stack password, press enter, as the password is an empty string.
:::

Next, deploy NativeLink to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -k \
    https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink//deploy/kubernetes-example
```

:::danger
This example is built for demo purposes only. It's not a secure production-grade
setup and will only work in the local development cluster created with
`native up`.

One-liner production-grade setups are still under construction.

## 🔭 Explore deployments

The deployment might take a wile to boot up. You can monitor progress via the
dashboards that come with the development cluster:

- [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080): Cilium's Hubble UI to view the
  cluster topology. NativeLink will be deployed into the `default` namespace.
- [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081): The Tekton Dashboard to view the
  progress of the in-cluster pipelines. You'll find the pipelines under the
  `PipelineRuns` tab.
- [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000): The Capacitor Dashboard to view Flux
  Kustomizations. You can view NatieLink's logs here once it's fully deployed.

In terminals, the following commands can be helpful to view deployment progress:

- `tkn pr logs -f` to view the logs of a `PipelineRun` in the terminal.
- `flux get all -A` to view the state of the NativeLink deployments.

Once NativeLink is deployed:

- `kubectl logs deploy/nativelink-cas` for the CAS (cache) logs.
- `kubectl logs deploy/nativelink-scheduler` for the scheduler logs.
- `kubectl logs deploy/nativelink-worker` for the worker logs.

## 🏗️ Build against NativeLink

The demo setup creates gateways to expose the `cas` and `scheduler` deployments
via your local docker network. You can pass the Gateway addresses to Bazel
invocations to make builds run against the cluster:

```bash
NATIVELINK=$(kubectl get gtw nativelink-gateway -o=jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')

echo "NativeLink IP: $NATIVELINK"

bazel build \
    --remote_cache=grpc://$NATIVELINK \
    --remote_executor=grpc://$NATIVELINK \
    //local-remote-execution/examples:hello_lre
```

:::caution
While the Dashboard ports are static, the NativeLink endpoints aren't (yet).
If you shut down the cluster and reboot it, the `$NATIVELINK` IP addresses will
change.
:::

:::tip
You can add these flags to a to a `.bazelrc.user` file in the workspace root.
Note that you'll need to pass in explicit IP addresses as this file can't
resolve environment variables:
```bash
# .bazelrc.user
build --remote_cache=grpc://172.20.255.4
build --remote_executor=grpc://172.20.255.4
```

```bash
# .bazelrc
try-import %workspace%/.bazelrc.user
```
:::

The crucial part is this bit:

```txt
INFO: 11 processes: 9 internal, 2 remote.
```

It tells us that the compilation ran against the cluster. Let's clean the Bazel
cache and run the build again:

```bash
bazel clean && bazel build \
    --remote_cache=grpc://$CACHE \
    --remote_executor=grpc://$SCHEDULER \
    //local-remote-execution/examples:hello_lre
```

The build now shows cache hits instead of remote actions:

```txt
INFO: 11 processes: 2 remote cache hit, 9 internal.
```

## 🚀 Bonus: Local Remote Execution

The worker deployment in this example leverages [Local Remote Execution](../explanations/lre).

Local Remote Execution mirrors toolchains for remote execution in your local
development environment. This lets you reuse build artifacts with virtually
perfect cache hit rate across different repositories, developers, and CI.

To test LRE in the cluster, clean the local cache and invoke another build
against the cluster, but this time omit the `remote_executor` flag. This way
you'll use remote caching without remote execution:

```bash
bazel clean && bazel build \
    --remote_cache=grpc://$CACHE \
    //local-remote-execution/examples:hello_lre
```

You'll get remote cache hits as if your local machine was a `nativelink-worker`:

```txt
INFO: 11 processes: 2 remote cache hit, 9 internal.
```

## 🧹 Clean up

When you're done testing, delete the cluster:

```bash
# Delete the kind cluster
native down

# Remove the container registry and loadbalancer
docker container stop kind-registry | xargs docker rm
docker container stop kind-loadbalancer | xargs docker rm
```
