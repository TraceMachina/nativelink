Local Remote Execution (LRE) is a system for rapid iteration on toolchain setups.

It offers a framework for developers to build, distribute, and swiftly alter
custom toolchain configurations. This system aims to be transparent, fully
hermetic, and reproducible across machines with the same system architecture.
