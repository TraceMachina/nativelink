Remote execution is a powerful feature that allows you to distribute build
and test actions across multiple machines, such as a data center.
This can significantly speed up your build times and improve your development workflow.

By leveraging remote execution, you can enjoy the following benefits:

- **Faster build and test execution**: By distributing actions across multiple nodes,
you can execute builds and tests in parallel, significantly reducing the overall time required.
- **Consistent execution environment**: Remote execution ensures that all members of
a development team are working in the same environment, reducing the
"it works on my machine" problem.
- **Reuse of build outputs**: Build outputs can be shared across a development team,
 reducing redundant work and further speeding up the development process.

For more information on how to get started with remote execution in NativeLink,
please refer to our [NativeLink On-Prem Guide](/docs/introduction/on-prem).
