## Overview of hermeticity

Hermeticity in the context of build systems refers to the principle of isolation
from changes to the host system. This means that given the same input source
code and product configuration, a hermetic build system will always produce the
same output. This is achieved by making the build process insensitive to
libraries and other software installed on the host machine. Instead, hermetic
builds depend on specific versions of build tools and dependencies, making the
build process self-contained and independent of external services.

## How to achieve hermeticity

Isolation and source identity are the two key aspects of hermeticity. Isolation
is achieved by treating tools as source code, downloading copies of tools, and
managing their storage and use within managed file trees. This creates a
separation between the host machine and the local user, including installed
versions of languages. Source identity ensures the sameness of inputs by using
unique hash codes to identify changes to the build's input.

Isolation is crucial as it ensures that the build process isn't affected by
changes in the host system, leading to consistent and predictable build outputs.
On the other hand, non-isolation can lead to unpredictable build outputs and
potential security risks as the build process could be influenced by potentially
malicious software installed on the host system.

Hermetic builds offer several benefits including speed, parallel execution,
ability to build multiple builds on the same machine using different tools and
versions, and reproducibility. However, it's important to identify and address
non-hermeticity in your builds.

## Non-hermeticity causes

Common sources of non-hermeticity include
arbitrary processing in .mk files, actions or tooling that create files
non-deterministically, system binaries that differ across hosts, and writing to
the source tree during the build. To troubleshoot non-hermetic builds, you can
ensure null sequential builds, debug local cache hits from a variety of potential
client machines, execute a build within a docker container, and enable strict
sandboxing at the per-action level.
