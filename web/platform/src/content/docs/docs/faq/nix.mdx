Nix is a powerful, cross-platform package manager that offers a high
'power-to-weight ratio'. It provides a range of features including
reproducible development environments, system configuration,
language-agnostic build-tool, continuous integration environment,
deployment machine configuration, upgrade rollbacks, and package
isolation (sandboxing).

Nix's package isolation (sandboxing) and reproducible builds and
environments are particularly important for enabling advanced remote
execution setups. With Nix, you can define the dependencies needed to
work on a project in any language(s) in a single file. This allows
anyone with Nix installed to spawn a shell with the necessary
dependencies installed in a single command.

Nix's purely functional nature means that it makes changes in a very
self-contained way. All packages installed by Nix live in the Nix store,
usually the /nix/store directory. Packages are installed in folders with
names that contain a hash of the package’s dependencies, and symlinks
are created in paths like ~/.nix-profile/bin. This enables features like
rollbacks and means that upgrading (or uninstalling) one package won’t
affect your other packages.

In the context of remote execution setups, this means that you can have
a high degree of confidence that the environment in which your code is
being executed is exactly as you specified it, regardless of where that
execution is taking place. This hermeticity is crucial for ensuring the
reliability and reproducibility of remote execution.

To get started with Nix, you can install it seamlessly on most platforms.
Once installed, you can start defining your project's dependencies in a
shell.nix file and use the nix-shell command to spawn a shell with those
dependencies installed.
