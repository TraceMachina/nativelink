You can self-host NativeLink at no cost.

## NativeLink Cloud

NativeLink Cloud has **straightforward, usage-based pricing**. This isn't a
free service. We charge based on:

- Compute resources used for remote execution
- Storage of build artifacts and cache entries
- Data transfer and bandwidth

Contact our team for current pricing details and to discuss your specific
workload requirements.
