This guide shows how to connect your [Pantsbuild](https://www.pantsbuild.org/)
project to [NativeLink Cloud](https://app.nativelink.com).

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. If you can't find a `pants.toml` file, create one in the root directory of
   your Pantsbuild project:

   <FileTree>
   - project/
       - get-pants.sh
       - BUILD
       - **pants.toml**
   </FileTree>

2. Copy the following lines into your `pants.toml`:

    ```toml
    # pants.toml
    [GLOBAL]
    remote_cache_read = true
    remote_cache_write = true
    remote_store_address = "[REMOTE_STORE_ADDRESS]"

    [GLOBAL.remote_store_headers]
    x-nativelink-api-key = "[API_KEY]"
    ```

   :::note
   Fill in the `REMOTE_STORE_ADDRESS` and `API_KEY` from the [NativeLink Cloud](https://app.nativelink.com).
   :::

3. Run a pants build with the following flags:

   ```bash
   pants --no-pantsd --no-local-cache test ::
   ```

   `--no-pantsd` and `--no-local-cache` aren't how you’d normally want to run Pants. They’re just there to prevent the daemon and the local cache from preempting the remote cache, so you can see the latter in action.

4. You'll see remote cache use on the [Dashboard](https://app.nativelink.com)
   page.

</Steps>
