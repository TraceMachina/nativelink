NativeLink Cloud RBE is currently in limited release. Please request access from the
Remote Execution page in the NativeLink Cloud to enable RBE.
:::

This guide shows how to configure remote build execution (RBE) for your
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) projects with the
[NativeLink Cloud](https://app.nativelink.com). Before using this guide
make sure you have followed our [Bazel Quickstart](/docs/nativelink-cloud/bazel).

## Basic Configuration
To enable RBE all you need to do is add the below flag to your Bazel builds:
```bash
--remote_executor=grpcs://scheduler-YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE.build-faster.nativelink.net:443
```

This will run your builds on a Ubuntu 22.04 image *without any* dependencies installed.
For most users we don't expect this to work out of the box as your project most
likely depends on installations like GCC/Java/etc. To remedy that, continue with the
instructions below to pass in your own images.

## Custom Images
To support most RBE builds you will most likely need to pass in your own image with the
correct toolchains installed to support your build. To use your own __*public*__ image you can pass
it using this configuration:
```bash
--remote_default_exec_properties="container-image=docker://public.ecr.aws/ubuntu/ubuntu:22.04_stable"
```
Or a public image on Docker Hub is accessible via:
```bash
--remote_default_exec_properties="container-image=docker://ubuntu:latest"
```

### Private Images
If your images are in your own private repository, you can pass your repository
credentials to allow us to pull your RBE images.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="platfomr">
  <TabItem label="AWS">
    ```bash
    --remote_default_exec_properties="container-image=docker://123456789100.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rbe-images:tag"
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-server=123456789100.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-username=AWS
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-password="$(aws ecr get-login-password --region YOUR_REGION)"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Google Cloud">
    ```bash
    --remote_default_exec_properties="container-image=docker://gcr.io/rbe-images/image"
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-server=gcr.io
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-username=_dcgcloud_token
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-password="$(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Docker.io">
    ```bash
    --remote_default_exec_properties="container-image=docker://docker.io/rbe-images/image"
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-server=docker.io
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-username=YOUR_USERNAME
    --remote_exec_header=x-nativelink-rbe-registry-password=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Hermetic Bazel Builds
An alternative option to passing in your own custom image is using a fully hermetic
Bazel build. This will allow you to use our default Ubuntu 22.04 image and your Bazel
commands will install all needed dependencies.

You can see a sample of that in the WORKSPACE file of our **Hermetic CC** example
repository [here](https://github.com/TraceMachina/hermetic_cc_toolchain_rbe_example/blob/main/WORKSPACE).

## Recommended Flags
Bazel has many flags you can pass to it to modify RBE. We recommend three main flags to start.

### `--jobs`
This is the number of concurrent jobs to run. We recommend starting with `50` but
you can readily scale up to `200`. Past this we recommend reaching out to us with help
understanding your build and what optimal settings may be.
```bash
--jobs=200
```

### `--remote_download_minimal`
This flag enables "Build Without Bytes" which means Bazel will skip downloading
intermediate artifacts that aren't necessary for your builds to complete. This
can greatly increase the speed of your builds.
```bash
--remote_download_minimal
```

### `--remote_timeout`
This is how long a job will run before timing out. The default is `60` seconds but we
recommend setting `600`.
```bash
--remote_timeout=600
```

### Further configurations
You can see the rest of the Bazel command line arguments [here](https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference),
and don't hesitate to reach out to us with any questions!

## Execution Properties
You may have jobs that you need to configure to run on specific hardware, whether that's `GPUs` or `High Memory`. In
order to enable this, we utilize Bazel's `exec_properties`. Inside a specific rule you can pass a `node` value
that will map those tasks to the type of worker node you want to run your task on.

```bash
my_rule(
    name = 'my_target',
    exec_properties = {
        'Pool': 'gpu-cuda'
    }
    â€¦
)
```
To configure accepted values of `Pool` for your builds please reach out to us to get setup.
