While NativeLink offers robust cloud solutions, we understand
that you may need to run NativeLink on-premises for various
reasons such as compliance requirements, unique scaling needs,
or specific infrastructure setups.

To facilitate this, NativeLink is designed to be seamlessly
deployable in an on-premises environment. Our team has worked
hard to ensure that the process of setting up NativeLink on
your own servers is as straightforward as possible, and we
provide comprehensive documentation to guide you through the process.

## Making your First Deployment
To get started with running NativeLink on-premises, we recommend taking a
look at our example deployments and NativeLink configurations that may suit
your needs.

- [**On-Prem Example Deployments**](/docs/deployment-examples/on-prem-overview):
This section provides several examples of deploying NativeLink to an
on-premises Kubernetes setup. These examples aren't intended for production
use, but rather to serve as basic, illustrative guides for using NativeLink
in a custom Kubernetes environment.

- [**Configuration Examples**](/docs/config/configuration-intro):
NativeLink uses a JSON file as the configuration format. This section provides
a few examples of configuration files that you can refer to when setting up
your own NativeLink configuration.

If you encounter any issues
or have any questions about running NativeLink on-premises, don't hesitate to
