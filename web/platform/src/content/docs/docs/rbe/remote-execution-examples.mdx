title: Classic remote execution examples
description: Guidance on testing remote execution capabilities.
---

Debugging remote builds can be tricky. These examples provide builds that you
can use to test the remote execution capabilities of your worker image.

:::caution
Most builds don't work out of the box when running under remote execution,
including some builds in these examples.

None of these builds are "recommended" targets. Some invocations might have bugs
and raise build errors. Use these tests purely to get a better picture of what
does and doesn't work with your remote execution setup.
:::

## Getting the test sources

All examples are in a single Bazel module at [`nativelink/toolchain-examples`](https://github.com/TraceMachina/tree/main/toolchain-examples).

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="tooling">
  <TabItem label="Nix">
    If you haven't set up Nix yet, consider consulting the [local development setup guide](https://www.nativelink.com/docs/contribute/guidelines#local-development-setup)
    guide. Then move to the `toolchain-examples` directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink
    cd nativelink/toolchain-examples

    # If you haven't set up `direnv`, remember to activate the Nix flake
    # manually via `nix develop`.
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bazelisk">
    If you running outside of Nix, install [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/tree/master). Then move to the `toolchain-examples` directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink
    cd nativelink/toolchain-examples
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::caution
At the moment all examples assume that your host is an `x86_64-linux` system.

## Preparing the remote execution infrastructure

<Tabs syncKey="deployment">
  <TabItem label="Kubernetes">
    Port-forward your NativeLink cas/scheduler service to `localhost:50051`:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward svc/YOURSERVICE 50051
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Docker">
    Likely the most straightforward way to test a remote execution image is by
    creating a custom "test image" that you debug locally. If you have an
    existing Dockerfile, here is what you need to adjust to test remote
    execution against a locally running worker:

    ```dockerfile
    # INSERT YOUR EXISTING DOCKERFILE CONTENTS HERE.

    # ...

    # Append something similar to the section below. We assume that you've built
    # nativelink at a recent commit via
    # `nix build github:Tracemachina/nativelink`.
    #
    # Then copy the executable and the `nativelink-config.json` from the
    # `toolchain-examples` directory into the image and set the entrypoint to
    # nativelink with that config.

    COPY nativelink /usr/bin/nativelink
    COPY nativelink-config.json /etc/nativelink-config.json

    RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/nativelink

    ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/nativelink"]
    CMD ["/etc/nativelink-config.json"]
    ```

    Then build your image and push it to your localhost:

    ```bash
    docker build . \
        -t rbetests:local
    ```

    You can now run the remote execution image locally and run builds against
    it:

    ```bash
    docker run \
        -e RUST_LOG=info \
        -p 50051:50051 \
        rbetests:local
    ```

    :::caution
    Don't use the image you created here as worker for your cloud deployments.
    Your worker should **not** bundle the nativelink executable. Instead, the
    cloud deployments will automatically inject nativelink with an appropriate
    config into your worker pods.
    :::
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

All future invocations may now use the `--remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051`
and `--remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051` flags to send builds to the
running container.

## Available toolchain configurations

This Bazel module comes with some commonly used toolchains that you can enable
via `--config` flags. See the `.bazelrc` file in the `toolchain-examples`
directory for details. Here are your options:

| Config | Hermetic | Size | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `zig-cc` | yes | ~100Mb | Hermetic, but slow. The intended use for this toolchain are projects that need a baseline C++ toolchain, but aren't "real" C++ projects, such as Go projects with a limited number of C FFIs. |
| `llvm` | no | ~1.5Gb | Not hermetic, but fast and standardized. This toolchain tends to be safe to use for C++ projects as long as you don't require full hermeticity. Your remote execution image needs to bundle `glibc <= 2.34` for this toolchain to work. |
| `java` | yes | ? | This sets the JDK to use a remote JDK. Use this one for Java. |

### Notes on how to register your toolchains

:::danger
Some toolchains come with a "register_toolchains" function. **DON'T USE IT IN
YOUR `MODULE.bazel` FILE**.
:::

Toolchains tend to be complex dependencies and you'll almost always have bugs in
your toolchain that are build-breaking for some users. If you register your
toolchain in your `MODULE.bazel` it'll turn such bugs into hard errors that
might require deep incisions into your toolchain configuration to fix them.

Instead, register platforms and toolchains in your `.bazelrc` file. This way you
give your users the option to opt out of your default toolchain and provide
their own. For instance:

```bash
build:sometoolchain --platforms @sometoolchain//TODO
build:sometoolchain --extra_toolchains @sometoolchain//TODO
```

Now `--config=sometoolchain` is your happy path, but you keep the ability to
omit the flag so that if your happy path doesn't work you still have the ability
to build with "unsupported" toolchains.

All examples below require some sort of `--config` flag to work with remote
execution.

## Minimal example targets

Examples to test whether your worker can function at all.

:::important
Since the toolchains used here tend to focus on ease of use rather than
performance, expect build times of several minutes even for a small "Hello
World" program.

Keep in mind that some remote toolchains first fetch tools to the executor. This
can take several minutes and might look like a slow compile action.
:::

:::caution
Depending on your store setup, you might need to add one of
`--digest_function=blake3` or `--digest_function=sha256` to your Bazel
invocation. Failing to do so might cause errors about mismatching or
nonexistent artifact hashes.
:::

### C and C++

<Tabs syncKey="toolchain">
  <TabItem label="zig-cc">
    ```bash
    bazel build //cpp \
        --config=zig-cc \
        --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
        --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="llvm">
    ```bash
    bazel build //cpp \
        --config=llvm \
        --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
        --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Python

:::caution
The default `rules_python` bootstrap process requires a preinstalled Python on
the worker. Minimal worker images or images with Python in unexpected locations
won't work if the bootstrap process can't find this preinstalled Python.

To work around this, it's paramount that you use the
`--@rules_python//python/config_settings:bootstrap_impl=script` flag either in
your `.bazelrc` or on the command line. This overrides the bootstrap process
with a script that simulates a Python installation.

Failing to do so will cause your build to raise a bunch of errors and tests to
fail with confusing (but technically correct) "file not found" errors.
:::

```bash
bazel test //python \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051
```

### Go

```bash
bazel test //go \
    --config=zig-cc \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051
```

### Rust

:::caution
This one *shouldn't* work as `rules_rust` doesn't support remote execution.
If this build passes there is a high chance that you have an hermeticity issue
in your worker image.
:::

```bash
bazel test //rust \
    --config=zig-cc \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051

# Should raise and error like this if your toolchain is correctly hermetic:
#
# error: the self-contained linker was requested, but it wasn't found in the
# target's sysroot, or in rustc's sysroot
```

### Java

:::tip
Note the use of `--config=java` to ensure use of a RemoteJDK.
:::

```bash
bazel test //java:HelloWorld \
    --config=java \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051
```

### All at once

```bash
bazel test //... \
    --config=java \
    --config=zig-cc \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --keep_going
```

## Larger builds

These builds can help fine-tune larger deployments.

:::tip
Before building one of these larger projects, consider verifying the toolchain
for the respective language via the minimal examples above.
:::

### Curl (C)

```bash
bazel build @curl//... \
    --config=zig-cc \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051
```

### Zstandard (C)

```bash
bazel build @zstd//... \
    --config=zig-cc \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051
```

### Abseil-cpp (C++)

:::note
Expect a bunch of errors like `No repository visible as
'@com_github_google_benchmark'` as abseil doesn't fully declare its
dependencies. Use `--keep_going` here.
:::

```bash
bazel test @abseil-cpp//... \
    --config=zig-cc \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --keep_going
```

### Abseil-py (Python)

:::note
The `@abseil-py//absl/flags:tests/flags_test` fails on remote executors due to
potential permission restrictions.
:::

```bash
bazel test @abseil-py//... \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051
```

### CIRCL (Go)

:::note
Not all tests will build, so you need `--keep_going`.
:::

```bash
bazel test @circl//... \
    --config=zig-cc \
    --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --remote_executor=grpc://localhost:50051 \
    --keep_going
```
