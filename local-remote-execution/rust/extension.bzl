# TODO(aaronmondal): Using module extensions here isn't optimal as it doesn't
#                    allow overriding tools via environment variables.
#                    Unfortunately rules_rust's rust_toolchain currently
#                    requires tools to be declared via labels to filegroups,
#                    so we need the new_local_repository approach here.
#                    Add support for raw strings to rules_rust upstream so
#                    that we can remove this module extension entirely.
