/// An `Action` captures all the information about an execution which is required

///
/// `Action`s are the core component of the [Execution] service. A single
/// `Action` represents a repeatable action that can be performed by the
/// execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly identified by the digest of
/// their wire format encoding and, once an `Action` has been executed, will be
/// cached in the action cache. Future requests can then use the cached result
/// rather than needing to run afresh.

/// When a server completes execution of an

/// cache the [result][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.ActionResult] in
/// the [ActionCache][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.ActionCache] unless
/// `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the server to do so. By
/// default, future calls to
/// [Execute][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Execution.Execute] the same
/// `Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care
