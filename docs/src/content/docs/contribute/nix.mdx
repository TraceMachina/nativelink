title: Building NativeLink with Nix
description: Instructions on building NativeLink with Nix.
---

These instructions contain information on how to work with NativeLink for Nix
users.

You'll need a recent version of Nix with flakes enabled, for instance installed
via the [next-gen nix installer](https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer).

This build doesn't require cloning the repository, but you need to provide a
configuration file, for instance the one at [`https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/blob/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json`](./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json).

The following command builds and runs NativeLink in release (optimized) mode:

```sh
nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink ./basic_cas.json
```

You can build a specific PR or branch like so:

```sh
nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink?ref=pull/<PR_NUMBER>/head
```

## Working with container images

View the flake outputs to list available images:

```sh
nix flake show
```

The main `nativelink` container image is the `image` output. Other images follow
the pattern `nativelink-worker-*`.

Images use [nix2container](https://github.com/nlewo/nix2container) as builder
and get tagged with nix derivation hashes.

To build an image locally and make it available to your container runtime:

```sh
nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink#image.copyToDockerDaemon
```

To view the tag of an image

```sh
nix eval github:TraceMachina/nativelink#image.imageTag --raw
```
