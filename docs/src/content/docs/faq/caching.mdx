## Overview

Remote caching is a technique used by development teams and continuous
integration (CI) systems to share build outputs. If your build process is
reproducible, the outputs from one machine can be safely reused on another
machine, significantly speeding up the build process.

The build process is broken down into discrete steps, known as actions. Each
action has inputs, output names, a command line, and environment variables.
Required inputs and expected outputs are declared explicitly for each action.

A server like NativeLink can be set up to act as a remote cache for these build outputs. These
outputs consist of a list of output file names and the hashes of their contents.
With a remote cache, you can reuse build outputs from another user's build
rather than building each new output locally.

To use remote caching, you need to:

1. Set up NativeLink as the cache's back-end
2. Configure the build to use the remote cache
3. Use a build tool that supports remote caching

The remote cache stores two types of data:

1. Action result metadata in the Action Cache.
2. Output files in the CAS (Content Addressable Storage).

These two types of information can allow a complete
re-build without requiring any redundant build steps
saving significantly on time and compute.

## How Remote Caching Works

1. The build tool creates the graph of targets that need to be built, and then
   creates a list of required actions.
2. The build tool checks your local machine for existing build outputs and
   reuses any that it finds.
3. The build tool checks the cache for existing build outputs. If the output is
   found, the build tool retrieves the output. This is a cache hit.
4. For required actions where the outputs weren't found, the build tool
   executes the actions locally and creates the required build outputs.
5. New build outputs are uploaded to the remote cache.
