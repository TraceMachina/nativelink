# Modify this value to change the URL of the repository with deployment files.

# This is usually only necessary if you change deployment YAML files or
# NativeLink config files. If you only intend to change the Rust sources you can
# leave this as is and need to ensure that the Alerts below are patched to build
# your local sources.

# Setting the flake outputs to `./src_root#xxx` causes the Tekton pipelines to
# build nativelink from your local sources.
#
# During development, the following formats might be useful as well:
#
# `github:user/repo#outname` to build an image from an arbitrary flake output.
#
# `github:TraceMachina/nativelink?ref=pull/<PR_NUMBER>/head#<OUT>` to deploy a
# outputs from a Pull request.
